# 📧 Email Spam Filter

An intelligent machine learning-based Email Spam Filter designed to automatically detect and block unwanted spam emails. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to analyze email content and predict whether an email is spam or legitimate (ham).

## ✨ Features
- Preprocessing of email datasets (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Training models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Deep Learning-based classifiers
- Real-time spam prediction on new emails
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Lightweight, efficient, and ready for integration with email clients

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / SpaCy for NLP
- Pandas, NumPy
- Flask (for optional web API)

## 📚 Dataset
Uses popular datasets like the [Enron Spam Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) or [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/).

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-filter.git

```

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Clean and preprocess the email text.
2. Convert text to numerical features (TF-IDF or Bag of Words).
3. Train a classifier to distinguish spam from ham.
4. Predict the class of incoming emails in real-time.

## 💬 Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy using deep learning (LSTM, Transformer models)
- Build a browser extension or email client plugin
- Add multi-language support
